This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: a missing closing tag. The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.  Missing closing tags can cause unpredictable rendering issues in web browsers. Always ensure that all opening tags have their corresponding closing tags to maintain correct HTML structure and avoid unexpected layout problems.
